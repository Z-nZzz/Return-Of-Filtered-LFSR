# Return Of Filtered LFSR (ROFL)

Python and C implementation of a filter generator using Cyclic Weightwise Quadratic functions from [Yassine Ozaim and Pierrick MÃ©aux. On the cryptographic properties of weightwise affine and weightwise quadratic functions.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1680.pdf)

- In opti: a first optimization of the implementation in C.
- In naive: The naive implementation in C.
- In python: The Python implementation.
- In assess: srcipts used to estimate the cryptographic properties of the filter generator.
