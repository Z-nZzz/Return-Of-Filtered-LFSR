## All the scripts i used to assess the security of the filter generator 

- In approx: Scripts to do some estimations of the cryptographic properties of some CWQ functions.

- In taps: Scripts to plot graphs of the distributions of the distances for a few possible choices of taps (because bad choices can lead to an attack)

- In complexity: Scripts to computes the graphs of the complexities of the classical attacks on filtered LFSR.
